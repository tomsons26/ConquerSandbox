# Command & Conquer

This repository includes source code for Command & Conquer. This release provides support to the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=2229830) for the game.


## Dependencies

If you wish to rebuild the source code and tools successfully you will need to find or write new replacements (or remove the code using them entirely) for the following libraries;

- DirectX 5 SDK
- Greenleaf Communications Library (GCL)
- Human Machine Interface (HMI) “Sound Operating System” (SOS)



## Compiling (Win32 Only)

The current state of the source code does not fully compile and does not contain the core engine libraries (you can find these in the [Red Alert](https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Red_Alert) code repository) and will require some effort to restore it. If you wish to restore the original build environment, the following tools are required;

- Watcom C/C++ (v10.6) for C/C++ source files
- Borland Turbo Assembler (TASM v4.0) for assembly files
- Microsoft Micro Assembler (MASM v6.11d) for assembly files

To use the compiled binaries, you must own the game. The C&C Ultimate Collection is available for purchase on [EA App](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-the-ultimate-collection/buy/pc) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/39394/Command__Conquer_The_Ultimate_Collection/).
